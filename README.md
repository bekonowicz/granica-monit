Live app embedded [here](https://ukraina.grupagranica.pl/granica).


App helps coordinate volunteer work with refugees from Ukraine on Polish-Belarusian Border. Data comes from [Grupa Granica](https://www.grupagranica.pl/) â€“ a coalition of NGOs working with refugees in Poland. They monitor the situation at the borders, put data into a sheet, and this app only displays the data on the map.

The development was very quich, so the code lacks some elegance to it. Will be refactored later.
